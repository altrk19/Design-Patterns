Subject – is an interface which expose the functionality available to be used by the clients.

Real Subject – is a class implementing Subject and it is concrete implementation which needs to be hidden behind a proxy.

Proxy – hides the real object by extending it and clients communicate to real object via this proxy object. Usually frameworks create this proxy object when client request for real object.



When to use proxy design pattern
A proxy object hides the original object and control access to it. We can use proxy when we may want to use a class that can perform as an interface to something else.

Proxy is heavily used to implement lazy loading related usecases where we do not want to create full object until it is actually needed.

A proxy can be used to add an additional security layer around the original object as well.
